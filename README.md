# Node Auth Boilerplate
This is a boilerplate for an express app with local user authentication. It exists so I can have a customized boilerplate and I don't have to start from scratch on all my projects.

## What It Includes
* Local Auth (email and password)
* Passport and Passport-Local
* Sessions for saving user info and displaying flash messages
* Settings for PostgreSQL and Sequelize
* Hashed Passwords
* EJS templating and EJS layouts
* Sequelize User Model
